Sitcom topic analysis


For this project I sought to compare and contrast two American sitcoms to see what sorts of topics and subject matters they dealt with to see what this could say about popular conversation topics and what the Western society values at large. 

I approached the topic by using linguistic data (episode transcripts, one from each season of the two shows I compared), extracting topics, and visualizing said topics. My process looked like this:

1. Copy & paste transcripts into individual Word files, save as .docx files
2. Copy & paste texts from word files into Annif to see initial topic suggestions
3. Create tables from Annif results (trim the unnecessary words out)
4. Copy & paste tables into Excel, save as .xlsx files
5. Upload Excel files into Voyant for initial visualization (this step can be omitted if desired)
6. Convert strings of textual data into percentages using basic mathematics
7. Create Excel files from mathematic results, string categories are: category, year, percentage. Save 3 .xlsx files altogether: one of both showsâ€™ individual results and one with their results combined.
8. Upload the numeric Excel files from the previous step into RAW, create 3 streamgraphs
9. Discuss results


My main humanities research questions were:
1. What are the most frequent topics in both situational comedies? How have they changed over the years and why?
2. What do these topics and changes tell us about current topics within popular media? How is this connected to (American) society in the 1990s-2010s on a larger scale?
